# Slytherin-Fruit
The classic Snake &amp; Food game created using Computer Vision which includes Concepts like Color Detection, Placing PNG image over another image, checking for intersecting lines and drawing on an image. Game is made using Python &amp; OpenCV.
Here in this project there is a jpg file given as a path in the program of an apple which is to be shown on the screen in real time and the program runs in such a way that it detects the red colour object and then after detecting it follows the path in which the object is moved thus this applies the principle of colour detection.
